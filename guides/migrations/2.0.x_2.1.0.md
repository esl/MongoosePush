# Migration guide from 2.0.x to 2.1.0
There are a few changes necessary in the configuration files and a few additional, optional ones.
## Main config (`config/config.exs`)
MongoosePush supports structured logging in 2.1.0 release. To use that feature, there is a need to change logger configuration to use the new default.
Old logger config:

```elixir
config :logger, :console,
  format: "\n$dateT$time [$level] $metadata$levelpad$message\n",
  metadata: [:pid]
```

New logger config:
```elixir
config :logger, :console,
  format: {MongoosePush.Logger.LogFmt, :format},
  metadata: :all
```

Additionally there are a few new defaults needed to be set up:
```elixir
config :mongoose_push, MongoosePush.Service,
  fcm: MongoosePush.Service.FCM,
  apns: MongoosePush.Service.APNS

config :mongoose_push, backend_module: MongoosePush

config :phoenix, :json_library, Jason
```

Lastly, since 2.1.0 MongoosePush uses `Phoenix` instead of `Maru` and Maru config entry can be removed.
```elixir
config :maru, :test, false
```

## Environmental configs (`config/{prod|dev|test}.exs`)

### `Phoenix` in place of `Maru`
As mentioned earlier, MongoosePush uses `Phoenix` and the config has to be updated to reflect that change.
Old `Maru` config entry:
```elixir
config :maru, MongoosePush.Router,
  versioning: [
    using: :path
  ],
  https: [
    bind_addr: {:system, :string, "PUSH_HTTPS_BIND_ADDR", "127.0.0.1"},
    port: {:system, :integer, "PUSH_HTTPS_PORT", 8443},
    keyfile: {:system, :string, "PUSH_HTTPS_KEYFILE", "priv/ssl/fake_key.pem"},
    certfile: {:system, :string, "PUSH_HTTPS_CERTFILE", "priv/ssl/fake_cert.pem"},
    cacertfile: {:system, :string, "PUSH_HTTPS_CERTFILE", "priv/ssl/fake_cert.pem"},
    acceptors: {:system, :integer, "PUSH_HTTPS_ACCEPTORS", 100},
    otp_app: :mongoose_push
  ]
```
It should be removed completely and in its place there must be the new, `Phoenix` config entry:
```elixir
config :mongoose_push, MongoosePushWeb.Endpoint,
  https: [
    ip: {
      :system,
      # Custom type parser (Phoenix needs erlang-inet-style IP address)
      {MongoosePush.Config.Utils, :parse_bind_addr, []},
      "PUSH_HTTPS_BIND_ADDR",
      {127, 0, 0, 1}
    },
    port: {:system, :integer, "PUSH_HTTPS_PORT", 8443},
    keyfile: {:system, :string, "PUSH_HTTPS_KEYFILE", "priv/ssl/fake_key.pem"},
    certfile: {:system, :string, "PUSH_HTTPS_CERTFILE", "priv/ssl/fake_cert.pem"},
    cacertfile: {:system, :string, "PUSH_HTTPS_CERTFILE", "priv/ssl/fake_cert.pem"},
    protocol_options: [
      # https://ninenines.eu/docs/en/cowboy/2.5/manual/cowboy_http/
    ],
    transport_options: [
      # https://ninenines.eu/docs/en/ranch/1.6/manual/ranch_tcp/
      # https://ninenines.eu/docs/en/ranch/1.6/manual/ranch_ssl/
      num_acceptors: {:system, :integer, "PUSH_HTTPS_ACCEPTORS", 100}
    ],
    otp_app: :mongoose_push
  ],
  debug_errors: false,
  code_reloader: false,
  check_origin: true,
  server: true
  ```
  As you can see, there is no change in the variables used to parse the options.

### Logging
Old logging entry looked like that:
```elixir
config :mongoose_push, loglevel: {:system, :atom, "PUSH_LOGLEVEL", :info}
```

New logging entry may look like that:
```elixir
config :mongoose_push, :logging,
  level: {:system, :atom, "PUSH_LOGLEVEL", :info},
  format: {:system, :atom, "PUSH_LOGFORMAT", :json}
```

The structure changed a little and there is a new variable, `PUSH_LOGFORMAT`. It defaults to `:json` for `prod` environment and to `:logfmt` for `dev` and `test` environment.

### OpenAPI
MongoosePush can expose OpenAPI specification if enabled. Config entry may look like this:
```elixir
config :mongoose_push,
  openapi: [
    expose_spec: {:system, :boolean, "PUSH_OPENAPI_EXPOSE_SPEC", false},
    expose_ui: {:system, :boolean, "PUSH_OPENAPI_EXPOSE_UI", false}
  ]
  ```
`PUSH_OPENAPI_EXPOSE_SPEC` enables OpenAPI endpoint support and `PUSH_OPENAPI_EXPOSE_UI` enables SwaggerUI. Both these options are disbaled by default. For more details refer to the `configuration` guide.

### Elixometer
MongoosePush does not use `Elixometer` for its metrics anymore. Metrics are provided using `Telemetry` and `elixometer` config entry should be removed.
Old `elixometer` entry:
```elixir
config :elixometer,
  reporter: :exometer_report_tty,
  env: Mix.env(),
  metric_prefix: "mongoose_push"
  ```

There is no config entry necessary for `Telemetry` metrics. To learn more about the new metrics check out the `metrics` guide.
