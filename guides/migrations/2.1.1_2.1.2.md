# Migration guide from 2.1.1 to 2.1.2

## Configuration via environmental variables

Configuration options `PUSH_APNS_ENABLED` and `PUSH_FCM_ENABLED` have changed their default value from `true` to `false`.
In case of a deployment (e.g. with Docker) where those variables were not set,
to keep the same behaviour they need to be explicitly set to `true`.

### Example

Old way of running MongoosePush with Docker:

```bash
docker run -v `pwd`/priv:/opt/app/priv \
  -v `pwd`/var:/opt/app/var \
  -e PUSH_HTTPS_CERTFILE="/opt/app/priv/ssl/rest_cert.pem" \
  -e PUSH_HTTPS_KEYFILE="/opt/app/priv/ssl/rest_key.pem" \
  -it --rm mongooseim/mongoose-push:2.1.1
```

Now it has to be:

```bash
docker run -v `pwd`/priv:/opt/app/priv \
  -v `pwd`/var:/opt/app/var \
  -e PUSH_HTTPS_CERTFILE="/opt/app/priv/ssl/rest_cert.pem" \
  -e PUSH_HTTPS_KEYFILE="/opt/app/priv/ssl/rest_key.pem" \
  -e PUSH_APNS_ENABLED=true \
  -e PUSH_FCM_ENABLED=true \
  -it --rm mongooseim/mongoose-push:2.1.2
```
