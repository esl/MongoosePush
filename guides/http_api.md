# HTTP API

If for some reason you need `Swagger` specs for this `RESTful` service, there is a swagger endpoint available via an `HTTP` path `/swagger.json`

## Request

There is only one endpoint at the moment:
* `POST /{version}/notification/{device_id}`

As you can imagine, `{device_id}` should be replaced with a device ID/Token generated by your push notification provider (`FCM` or `APNS`). The notification should be sent as a `JSON` payload of this request. A minimal `JSON` request could be like this:

```json
{
  "service": "apns",
  "alert":
    {
      "body": "notification's text body",
      "title": "notification's title"
    }
}
```

The full list of options contains the following:
* **service** (*required*, `apns` or `fcm`) - push notifications provider to be used for this notification
* **mode** (*optional*, `prod` (default) or `dev`) - allows for selecting named pool configured in `MongoosePush`
* **priority** (*optional*) - Either `normal` or `high`. Those values are used without changes for FCM. For APNS however, `normal` maps to priority `5`, while `high` maps to priority `10`. Please refer to FCM / APNS documentation for more details on those values. By default `priority` is not set at all, therefore the push notification service decides which value is used by default.
* **time_to_live** (*optional*) - Maximum lifespan of an FCM notification. For more details, please, refer to [the official FCM documentation](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cloud-messaging/concept-options#ttl).
* **mutable_content** (*optional*, `true` / `false` (default)) - Only applicable to APNS. Sets "mutable-content=1" in the APNS payload.
* **topic** (*optional*, `APNS` specific) - if the APNS certificate configured in `MongoosePush` allows for multiple applications, this field selects the application. Please refer to the `APNS` documentation for more details.
* **tags** (*optional*) - a list of tags used to choose a pool with matching tags. To see how tags work read: https://github.com/esl/sparrow#tags
* **data** (*optional*) - custom JSON structure sent to the target device. For `APNS`, all keys from this structure are merged into the highest level APS message (the one that holds the 'aps' key), while for `FCM` the whole `data` json structure is sent as FCM's `data payload` along with `notification`.
* **alert** (*optional*) - JSON structure that if provided will send a non-silent notification with the following fields:
  * **body** (*required*) - text body of the notification
  * **title** (*required*) - short title of the notification
  * **click_action** (*optional*) - for `FCM` its `activity` to run when notification is clicked. For `APNS` its `category` to invoke. Please refer to the Android/iOS documentation for more details about this action
  * **tag** (*optional*, `FCM` specific) - notifications aggregation key
  * **badge** (*optional*, `APNS` specific) - unread notifications count
  * **sound** (*optional*) - sound that should be play when the notification arrives. Please refer to the FCM / APNS documentation for more details.

Please note that either **alert** and **data** has to be provided (also can be both).
If you only specify **alert**, the request will result in a classic, simple notification.
If you only specify **data**, the request will result in a "silent" notification, i.e. the client will receive the data and will be able to decide whether and how the notification should be shown to the user.
If you specify both **alert** and **data**, the target device will receive both notification and the custom data payload to process.
