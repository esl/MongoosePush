  MongoosePush is simple (seriously) service providing ability to send push
  notification to `FCM` (Firebase Cloud Messaging) and/or
  `APNS` (Apple Push Notification Service). What makes it cool is not only
  simplicity but also support for newest and fastest `HTTP/2` based APIs
  for both services.

  At this moment only those two services are supported but in future
  MongoosePush may and probably will support even more Push Notification Services.

  Push notification defined by `request` to device with `device_id`.

  `:tag` is option
  specific to FCM service, while `:topic` and `:bagde` are specific to APNS
