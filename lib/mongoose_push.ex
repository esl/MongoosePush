  MongoosePush is simple (seriously) service providing ability to send push
  notification to `FCM` (Firebase Cloud Messaging) and/or
  `APNS` (Apple Push Notification Service). What makes it cool is not only
  simplicity but also support for newest and fastest `HTTP/2` based APIs
  for both services.

  At this moment only those two services are supported but in future
  MongoosePush may and probably will support even more Push Notification Services.

  @doc """
  Push notification defined by `request` to device with `device_id`.
  `request` has to define at least `:service` type (`:fcm` or `:apns`) and
  at least one of `:alert` or `:data`. If `alert` is not present, the notification will be send as 'silent'.
  Please refer to yours push notification service provider's documentation for more details on
  silent notifications.

  Field `:data` may contain any custom data that have to be delivered to the target device, while
  field `:alert`, if present, must contain at least `:title` and `:body`. The `:alert` field may also
  contain: :sound, `:tag` (option specific to FCM service), `:topic` and `:bagde` (specific to APNS).
  Please consult push notification service provider's documentation for more informations on those
  optional fields.

  Field `:priority` may be used to set priority for message on both FCM and APNS. The values are
  native for FCM and for APNS - :normal is "5" and :high is 10.

  `:mode` option is also specific to APNS but it only selects appropriate
  worker pool (with `:mode` set to either `:prod` or `:dev`).
  Default value to `:mode` is `:prod`.

  Field `:mutable_content` (specific to APNS) can be set to `true` (by default `false`) to enable
  this feature (please consult APNS documentation for more information).
